# Laravel Workflow

[Laravel Workflow](https://github.com/laravel-workflow/laravel-workflow) is a package for the Laravel web framework that provides tools for defining and managing workflows and activities. A workflow is a series of interconnected activities that are executed in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome. Activities are individual tasks or pieces of logic that are executed as part of a workflow.

Laravel Workflow can be used to automate and manage complex processes, such as agentic workflows (AI-driven), financial transactions, data analysis, data pipelines, microservices, job tracking, user signup flows and other business processes. By using Laravel Workflow, developers can break down large, complex processes into smaller, modular units that can be easily maintained and updated.

Some key features and benefits of [Laravel Workflow](https://github.com/laravel-workflow/laravel-workflow) include:

- Support for defining workflows and activities using simple, declarative PHP classes.
- Tools for starting, monitoring, and managing workflows, including support for queuing and parallel execution.
- Built-in support for handling errors and retries, ensuring that workflows are executed reliably and consistently.
- Integration with Laravel's queue and event systems, allowing workflows to be executed asynchronously on worker servers.
- Extensive documentation and a growing community of developers who use and contribute to Laravel Workflow.
