# Laravel Workflow

Welcome to the Laravel Workflow project! This project is dedicated to creating tools and libraries for developers to build and manage durable, long-running, persistent, distributed workflows (orchestrations) in PHP powered by Laravel Queues. It provides a simple and intuitive way to define complex asynchronous processes, such as data pipelines and microservices, as a sequence of activities that run in parallel or in series.

Laravel Workflow is built on top of Laravel, the popular PHP web framework, and uses its queue system and cache drivers to store and manage workflow data and state. It is designed to be scalable, reliable, and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity and maintainability.
